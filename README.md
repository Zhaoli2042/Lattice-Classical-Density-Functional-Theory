# Lattice-Classical-Density-Functional-Theory
* CLASSICAL ***NOT QUANTUM*** DFT
* THIS ONE LITTLE **MATLAB CODE** USES CLASSICAL ***NOT QUANTUM*** DFT TO SOLVE FOR LOCAL DENSITY PROFILE AND **CHEMICAL POTENTIAL SURFACE**.
* NOTE: X-AXIS IS PERIODIC WHILE Y-AXIS HAS WALLS ON BOTH SIDES
## ***APRIL FOOLS DAY UPDATE***
  * I FORGOT A FUNCTION FILE. NOW IT IS UPLOADED. count_rou_NN counts nearest neighbor rou(rho, density).
